TRYHACKME WALKTHROUGH

first we scan the target machine using NMAP

-> nmap -sV -sC -A -T4 $ip 

->the result gotten after the scan:

OPEN PORTS
----------
->[80]->http 

->[22]->ssh

->[8080]->http-proxy


->[8000]-> http


as you can see 'http" service is open. less try to check the website hosted.


![alt text](<webpage view 1-1.png>)

nothing interesting found on the website i would say. but let's find out if it has robots file:


run -> http://$ip:8000/robots.txt
 
 ![alt text](<flag 1-1.png>)

 and BINGO!ðŸ¥³.
 
 let's also check if there are other interesting directories using dirbuster

 -> gobuster dir -u http://$ip:8000 -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 


after some directory scrapping through, i got across an interesting directory: 
![alt text](<index zip 2-1.png>)

after accessing, it automatically downloads itself. it appears to be a zipped file. i unzip it and it contains two files:

1. app.py
2. flag2.txt

by using,

-> cat flag2.txt

we have found our flag 2 ladies and gentlemen!

![alt text](<flag 2-1.png>)


now onto flag 3 hunt!

let's dive into the "app.py script" to see if we can get something interesting.

when navigating through the file, i saw some directory paths like:

1. /administrator
2. /password_reset
3. /forgot_password


and usernames like:

1. jane

2. clarice

3. clocky_user

on the /forgot_password, you input the username and there is a token generated that validates the username can reset the passord(line 96-98).

so let's generate the token by ourselves. i've wrote a script that can help us generate the token.
-> [text](clock.py)

once run, give it a minute to provide the real token generated.

here is the token generated.
![alt text](token-1.png)




in order to have access to our admin platform, we must reset  the admin password from [/reset_password] along with the token provided.

-> http://ip/reset_password?token=[token generated]

after that you reset the admin password.

once successful you can go back to dashboard and enter "administrator' as username and the password you just reset.

![alt text](<flag 3-1.png>)

and here is flag 3!!!!

the location provided means that now we are in the webserver "paste the path you want to retrieve resources from". and i remember we have a database. maybe it can lead us to something great. 

-> ![alt text](location-1.png)


since we are on the webserver, it means that we can use "locahost".

so let's try:

-> http://localhost/

ERROR!  it says "action not permitted". basically This response is often associated with HTTP status codes like 403 (Forbidden), indicating that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.

so let's play around it and see if we can obtain something.

let's try to specify the database file which we've seen in the 'app.py' file.

-> http://localhost/database.sql

![alt text](database.sql-1.png)

after clicking download, there appears to be a download file. and it contains "flag 4"
